# DSA210 Project Proposal: Predicting 2023 Turkish General Election Results Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project aims to predict the 2023 Turkish general election results using GDP data and machine learning.
## Data
GDP per province (2009-2024) as an economic indicator. (https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Il-Bazinda-Gayrisafi-Yurt-Ici-Hasila-2023-53575)

Local Election results (2015, 2018, 2023) (https://www.ysk.gov.tr/tr/mahalli-idareler-genel-secimleri-arsivi/2650) grouped into:

-Conservative Right Bloc: AKP, MHP, Yeniden Refah

-Centrist Bloc: CHP, İYİ Parti

-Left Bloc: HDP/Yeşil Sol
## Methodology
Train a machine learning model using GDP (2015, 2018) to predict 2023 results.
Compare predictions with actual 2023 results to assess accuracy and correlation.
## Expected Outcome
Insights into the link between GDP and elections.
Evaluation of ML effectiveness in predicting results.
